I taught General Chemistry, Honors Chemistry, and Advanced Placement Chemistry at the high-school level for seven years, both in Philadelphia, PA and in upstate New York. I like to focus on main ideas and the fundamentals of chemistry while teaching and also like to use examples and demonstrations to explain concepts. Outside of teaching I work as a researcher developing a new technology for lithium ion batteries, and continue to operate a business manufacturing biodiesel.  I also like to hike, play music, and spend time with friends and family.  I look forward to helping a new group of students move forward in chemistry!</p>
